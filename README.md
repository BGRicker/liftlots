# README

* Create workouts like a playlist, update one set at a time iterating
  automatically through the workout

# TODO

* allow workouts to be edited in order. A workout will be an array of exercises, so this will need to load the edit page showing the corresponding information for each lift in that workout individually. If the workout saves correctly then the next workout is loaded
